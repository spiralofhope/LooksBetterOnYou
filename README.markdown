# Installation

Since it's a regular addon, it's manually installed the same as every other addon would be.

1) [Download LooksBetterOnYou](https://github.com/spiralofhope/LooksBetterOnYou/releases) 

2) Extract it to your `Interface\AddOns` folder.

Perhaps your game is installed to one of:

  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft` <br />
  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft (x86)` 

.. and so you would extract the contents of your downloaded archive to something like:

  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns` 

.. and so you would end up with the folder 

  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\LooksBetterOnYou`

.. and inside it would have `LooksBetterOnYou.lua` and all the other files.

([issues list](https://github.com/spiralofhope/LooksBetterOnYou/issues))

Limitations:

- The addon will show the correct race, sex, and gear, but there is currently no way to change which face, hair, etc., ... is shown. 


- If you seen an error, disable all addons but this one and re-test before creating an issue.
  -  If you have multiple addons installed, errors you think are for one addon may actually be for another.  No really, disable everything else.
- Search for your issue before creating an issue.
- Always report errors.
  -  There are several helpful addons to catch errors.  Try something like [TekErr](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info6681).
